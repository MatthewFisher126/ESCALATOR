# ESCALATOR container

## Download the container image

We have uploaded a container image at a momentary location [here](https://olucdenver-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/meng_lin_cuanschutz_edu/EWWez0EbEW9HmgKnQmO8WtoB1fMJ2K1gavSAg5WL_PBYig?e=zgn7bc)

## Container fork

Alternatively, you can build your own container using the scripts and def file provided at the forked directory from Matthew Fisher [here](https://github.com/MatthewFisher126/ESCALATOR), following the section [**"Using the container"**](https://github.com/MatthewFisher126/ESCALATOR?tab=readme-ov-file#using-the-container) 

If you are interested in following the development and using the scripts in a non-containerized form for general platforms, please also visit the directory above.

## Pipeline walkthrough

Please refer to the [vignette](escalator_container/ESCALATOR_container_readme.pdf) for pipeline logistics and the example code to run the container.
